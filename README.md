## Player
 * Camera has limits (top, right, bottom, left) set that are just inside inside the tilemap edges
   which prevents the camera from going outside the tilemap
   and showing undrawn sections
 * how to set up and animate player with script

## Tilemap
 * Layers (like you did before so you should remember this)
   * Ground , mid, and foreground using Z Index
